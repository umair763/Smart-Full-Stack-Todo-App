The project is successfully deployed on Vercel and authenticates users using Google Sign-In. However, there are critical issues after authentication:

The header and footer flash frequently after login.

The dashboard ("Tasks" panel) does not load â€” it only shows "Loading..." and never displays content.

The Three.js dynamic background renders correctly.

The database is connected, collections are created, and users are saved properly via Google Sign-In.

When the settings tab is clicked, the settings page loads correctly, but the header still continues to flash.

Start by analyzing the vercel.json file in the client/ directory. Identify and resolve the issue(s) causing these problems.
