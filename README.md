# Smart Todo App Enhancement Project

## Project Overview
We need to enhance our existing Smart Todo App with advanced features to improve user experience and functionality. The current codebase already has a solid foundation with task management, subtasks, and basic notifications. We'll build upon this to add more sophisticated features.

## Current Tech Stack
- Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js/Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Real-time: Socket.io
- Authentication: JWT + Google OAuth

## New Features to Implement

### 1. Due Dates & Reminders
- Enhance the existing date/time picker to support:
  - Custom reminder intervals (e.g., 15min, 1hr, 1day before)
  - Multiple reminders per task
  - Email/push notifications for reminders
- Integrate with the existing notification system
- Add a "Reminders" section in the task modal
- Store reminder preferences in user settings

### 2. Recurring Tasks
- Add recurrence options:
  - Daily (with specific days)
  - Weekly (with day selection)
  - Monthly (with date selection)
  - Custom intervals
- Implement recurrence pattern storage in MongoDB
- Add recurrence management UI in task creation/editing
- Handle task completion for recurring tasks (create next instance)

### 3. Dark Mode & Custom Themes
- Implement theme system:
  - Dark mode toggle
  - Custom color schemes
  - Theme persistence
- Create theme context/provider
- Add theme switcher in settings
- Ensure all components support theming
- Add CSS variables for theming

### 4. Task History & Audit Log
- Create new MongoDB collection for task history
- Track events:
  - Task creation/modification/deletion
  - Status changes
  - Subtask changes
  - User actions
- Add history view in UI
- Implement filtering and search for history
- Add export functionality

### 5. Search & Sort
- Implement advanced search:
  - Full-text search
  - Filter by:
    - Priority
    - Due date
    - Status
    - Tags
    - Subtasks
- Add sorting options:
  - Due date
  - Priority
  - Creation date
  - Alphabetical
- Create search context/provider
- Add search UI component

### 6. Notes/Attachments
- Add file upload system:
  - Support multiple file types
  - Image preview
  - File size limits
  - Storage management
- Implement rich text editor for notes
- Add attachment preview in task view
- Create attachment management UI

## Implementation Guidelines

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Set up new MongoDB collections
2. Create necessary API endpoints
3. Implement theme system
4. Add file upload infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Features
1. Implement recurring tasks
2. Add reminder system
3. Create search functionality
4. Build task history system

### Phase 3: UI/UX
1. Design and implement dark mode
2. Create attachment management UI
3. Build search interface
4. Add history view

### Phase 4: Polish
1. Add animations and transitions
2. Implement error handling
3. Add loading states
4. Optimize performance

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema Updates
```javascript
// Task Schema Additions
{
  recurrence: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['none', 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', 'custom'],
    default: 'none'
  },
  recurrencePattern: {
    type: Object,
    default: null
  },
  reminders: [{
    time: Date,
    type: String,
    sent: Boolean
  }],
  attachments: [{
    filename: String,
    path: String,
    type: String,
    size: Number
  }],
  notes: String,
  tags: [String]
}

// New History Schema
{
  taskId: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId,
  action: String,
  changes: Object,
  timestamp: Date
}
```

### API Endpoints to Add
- POST /api/tasks/:id/reminders
- GET /api/tasks/history
- POST /api/tasks/:id/attachments
- GET /api/tasks/search
- PATCH /api/tasks/:id/recurrence
- GET /api/tasks/filter

### UI Components to Create
- ThemeSwitcher
- ReminderPicker
- RecurrenceSelector
- FileUploader
- SearchBar
- HistoryViewer
- AttachmentPreview

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for new features
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical flows
- Performance testing for file uploads
- Theme switching tests
- Search functionality tests

## Documentation Needs
- API documentation updates
- Component documentation
- User guide for new features
- Theme customization guide
- File upload guidelines

## Performance Considerations
- Implement pagination for history
- Optimize file uploads
- Cache search results
- Lazy load attachments
- Optimize theme switching

## Security Considerations
- Validate file uploads
- Sanitize search inputs
- Secure file storage
- Rate limit API endpoints
- Validate recurrence patterns

## Accessibility Requirements
- Ensure dark mode meets WCAG
- Add ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Color contrast compliance

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 1 week
- Phase 2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3: 1 week
- Phase 4: 1 week

Total estimated time: 5 weeks

## Success Metrics
- User engagement with new features
- Task completion rates
- Search usage statistics
- Theme adoption
- File upload success rate
- System performance metrics

Please review this plan and provide feedback before we begin implementation. We'll need to prioritize features based on user needs and technical complexity.
